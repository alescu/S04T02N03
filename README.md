## Description

This project demonstrates how to persist a "Fruit" entity in an Mongo database in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

### Entity Definition

The `Fruit` entity has the following properties:

* `int id`: A unique identifier for the fruit.
* `String nom`: The name of the fruit.
* `double quantitatQuilos`: The quantity of the fruit in kilograms.

### Project Structure

Following the MVC pattern, the project is organized into the following packages (assuming the main package is `cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n01`):

* `cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n03.controllers`: Contains the controller classes responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and interacting with the service layer.
* `cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n03.model`: Contains the entity classes representing the data model (in this case, the `Fruit` entity).
* `cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n03.repository`: Contains the repository interfaces responsible for data access and persistence using JPA.
* `cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n03.exception`: (Optional) Contains any custom exception classes used in the application.

### API Endpoints

The `FruitsController` (located in the `controllers` package) provides the following REST API endpoints to manage fruit data:

* `POST http://localhost:8082/fruita/add`: Adds a new fruit. The request body will likely contain the `nom` and `quantitatQuilos` of the fruit.
* `PUT http://localhost:8082/fruita/update`: Updates an existing fruit. The request body will likely contain the `id`, `nom`, and `quantitatQuilos` of the fruit to be updated.
* `DELETE http://localhost:8082/fruita/delete/{id}`: Deletes a fruit with the specified `{id}`.
* `GET http://localhost:8082/fruita/getOne/{id}`: Retrieves the details of a fruit with the specified `{id}`.
* `GET http://localhost:8082/fruita/getAll`: Retrieves a list of all fruits.

This setup provides a basic RESTful API for managing `Fruit` entities persisted in an H2 database using JPA and following the principles of the MVC architecture.
